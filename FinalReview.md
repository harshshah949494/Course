### Short Answer

1) Name and define 2 agile **collary** practices.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

2) Name and define 2 confirmation management practices.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

3) Name and define 2 architecture patterns.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### Scenarios

1) A team finds it difficult to keep up with what others on their team are doing. What agile practice may help?
<br/>
<br/>


### Implementation

1) Measure the condition coverage of a code snippet. (10 points)

**Test suite**:

* `weird(0, 0, 0, "strictly", [0,0])`
* `weird(88, 42, 42, "stricter", [0,0])`

```Javascript
function weird(x,y,z, mode, results)
{
      if( x > 100 || y > 70 )
      {
          z = 33;
          results[0] = getData().data.server().first.name;
      }    
      else if( z == 0 && y < 0)
      {
          if( mode == "strictly" )
          {
              return 0;
          }
      }
      else if( z < 42 )
      {
          if( mode != "stricter" )
          {
              results[1] = getData().cachedResults.first.name;
              return y = z / x;
          }
      }
      return 1;
  }
```

2) Write a parser using a simple visitor pattern. 

Assume a visitor exists with this signature: `visit(node, callback)` and AST nodes contain parent information: `node.type`.


A) Count the number of branches in a function.

- What is number of branches in the above weird function?
- Parser implementation.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

B) Count the number of max conditions in a function.

- What is number of conditions in the above weird function?
- Parser implementation.

### Analyze

1) Two developers are debating about what type of configuration management to use in their organization: traditional or modern. Provide one advantage of traditional CM and one limitation. Provide one advantage of modern CM and one limitation.
